I commented out in the last release working. The games 
that were disabled but are now supported are:

Ozma Wars (Set 2)
Solar Fight

1.01 (26th August 2013)
-----------------------
I went through and tested all of the games.  I've commented
out the games that do not work anymore (many never did) and 
re-added the game list to the readme.

Some games have been updated so they use rom names from the 
latest MAME naming conventions:

Alien Invasion
Balloon Bomber
Galaxy Wars (Taito)
Invader's Revenge (Dutchford)
Jatre Specter (Set 2)
Space Invaders (CV Version)
Space Invaders Part II
Super Invaders (Emag)
Space War Part Three

1.0 (25th August 2013)
----------------------
It's been 9 years since the last release of Laser.
Much has changed since then, most notably the fact
that computers are much faster. Because of this, a
frame limiter (from SDL_gfx) has been added. Also,
sound is now set as always on. The -sound flag has
been removed.


1.0r1 (22nd March 2004)
-----------------------
This is the first SDL port of Laser. All future
development of Laser will be focused on the SDL
version. This is to aid with the ease of system
portability.

Discrete logic games are no longer available as
a result of the change over.

0.20 (30th July 2002)
---------------------
First official Win32 port of Laser, by ss_teven.
Thanks to Atani for the previous Win32 port. :D

Most everything from the pre-releases (MetaFox, ss_teven)

Added discrete logic games (MetaFox):

Pong - Keys are:
1 to start
Player 1 (Up: W, Down: S)
Player 2 (Up: 8 on the NumPad, Down: 2 on the Numpad)

Pong Doubles - a really fun game. :D Keys are:
1 to start
Player 1 (Up: W, Down: S)
Player 2 (Up: Y, Down: H)
Player 3 (Up: P, Down: ;)
Player 4 (Up: 8 on the NumPad, Down: 2 on the Numpad)
